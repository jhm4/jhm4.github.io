<p>Here at ediblecheesesandwich.com, we devote ourselves to creating the highest quality sandwich possible. Our Sandwartists come from around the world and share two things in common; expertise, and passion. We know that our masterpieces will have to meet our customers exacting standards. So, we take pride in exceeding them. Our meats, cheeses and vegetables come from only the best organic farms in many different regions. For example, Italy, France, Ecuador, Idaho and the Amazon. After we carefully hand select the ingredients, we ship them in a vacuum sealed, temperature controlled environment to our sandwich studio in Moscow. Here, our sandwartists, donning the cleanest clean-suits money can buy, open the shipping environment and delicately place the ingredients on the bread. After this they are sent to our loyal customers for consuming.</p>

<p><i>Not just a sandwich...the <b>perfect</b> sandwich.</i></p>
